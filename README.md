# 🧠 Quantum Harbor – A Visual Portfolio

Welcome to **Quantum Harbor**, an interactive 3D experience that represents the inner harbor of my mind. This project is my personal portfolio, my dynamic resume, and a symbolic map of my learning journey.

## 🚢 Concept

Quantum Harbor is built to visually express who I am, what I learn, and what I strive for. Inspired by port cities and neural networks, each element has a personal meaning:

- 🗼 **The Lighthouse**: Symbolizes God's guidance—always present, never imposing.
- 🚤 **Ships**: Represent individual projects, courses, or certifications.
- ⚓ **The Harbor**: My mind, where ideas dock and connect.
- 🧠 **Neural Activation**: When a ship arrives, a neural node activates—signifying completed understanding or achievement.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project serves as:
- A live **interactive portfolio**.
- A tool to track and show my **progress in studies** (like English and Python).
- A **creative résumé** for future opportunities.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🖥️ **JavaScript (ESModules)**
- 🌐 **Three.js**
- 🧭 **OrbitControls** for 3D navigation
- 📦 Node.js & NPM for module management
- 🧠 [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) for importing 3D models
