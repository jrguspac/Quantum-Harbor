## üìù Section Notes

### üìò Section 1 - Welcome

**Date:** 2025-05-04
**Summary:*
The introduction is about the main topics of the course and teacher Ardit Sulce. He is a programmer and freelancer who has worked on Udemy for six years. He explained that we will learn how and why to use different types of Python code. The main points he gave us are dedication, code writing, and improving code. Ardit recommended two paths to take when we get stuck: Stack Overflow and Udemy.com, as well as the Q&A section on the Udemy platform. These resources can help us find answers to specific topics. He also provided us with helpful resources, such as: Daily Python Projects (https://dailypythonprojects.substack.com), Python Chat Community (https://substack.com/chat/2286155).
